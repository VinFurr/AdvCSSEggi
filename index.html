    <span>I won't always be</span><br>
    <span>in this shell, you know.</span><br>
    <span>I've hatched a brilliant plan.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <span>I'll push my way out</span><br>
    <span>when the time is just right,</span><br>
    <span>and see what sort of creature I am.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <span>I bet I'll have fangs</span><br>
    <span>and a long, slimy tail</span><br>
    <span>that rattles when I get upset.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <span>My three glowing eyes</span><br>
    <span>will sit nicely beside</span><br>
    <span>the horn growing out of my head.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <span>I'll hang upside-down</span><br>
    <span>dripping poisonous goo</span><br>
    <span>from the tips of my eight, hairy legs.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <span>I can't wait to see</span><br>
    <span>just how scary I'll be</span><br>
    <span>when I finally get out of this egg!</span>
