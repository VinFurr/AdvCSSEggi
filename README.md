Group name: Eggi (named after a norwegian mountain)

Poem for the assignment: Egg poem from the book "Moosecklumps and other poems" by Ryan T. Bliss (2013)


The assignment
For this assignment we have used GitHub repositories to be able to commit changes on the project and work on the same codes from different devices. We have implemented SASS variables, function and nesting in the project and BEM as the naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS, and we have built our code on good coding practices. We have built the layout using CSS grid and the page is responsive with media queries. 


The layout
To animate the text we have used CSS animations, transformations and transitions as well as some Javascript when it came to triggering the animation with the help of ScrollMagic. The layout features an egg that is constant to the page and cracks as you scroll through the poem, and the verses appear alongside the egg. We thought it would be fitting as we got the inspiration for the layout from classic poem layouts with illustration and text or from childrens books. The illustrations are created with SVGs from Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Fresco and ClipPaths. At the end we have included end credits to the author of the poems and ourselves. 


Our separation of concerns: 
- Maintain best practices with DRY and YAGNI
- Seperate it based on concern
  - style
  - media-query
  - layout
  - keyframes
  - animation
